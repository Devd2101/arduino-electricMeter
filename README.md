# arduino-electricMeter
In This project we have used external Interrupt to sense the pulse from electric Meter. We have break out two wires from the Meter which is marked as cal Led. We connect the positive lead to interrupt pin on Arduino (pin 2 or pin 3) and ground pin to ground on Arduino. Also used the onboard EEPROM to save the previous value of meter reading.  used external Interrupt to sense the pulse from electric Meter.
